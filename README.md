# Frontend Homework 9

I have completed my nineth homework. 

React seems fun, and the homework didn't take much time. 
I still feel like CSS is my biggest weakness.

Understanding ghow Typescript, Javascript and React interacts with each other is still tricky, 
but I'm ready to learn and practice.
